# Prime Tier 1 Week 2

This week we introduced the programming language of the Internet, JavaScript. With JavaScript we can make our websites smart by adding interactivity and logic.

## Topics Covered
* Variables and Constants
* Conditional statements


## Assignment

As always, start off by forking and cloning this repository from GitHub. Open the code up in Atom to get started.

Remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go (just like you did to see your 'Hello World' last week!).

### Files Provided

This week you'll be completing the scripts in the following files. But note, that we have different levels of difficulty.

- [ ] *index.html* (Required Features)
- [ ] *aboutMe.js* (Required Features, Stretch Goals)

The .js file contains comments with prompts on what code to write. Do not erase the comments, just write the code below each commented line.

#### Levels of Difficulty

Above, we introduced the concept of levels of difficulty. Below is a brief explanation of:

* what to expect when attempting each level
* if they are required or not

Level | Description
--- | ---
Required Features | required
Stretch Goals | optional, stretches your understanding and may require additional research

**NOTE:** All the *.js* files are already sourced into *index.html*.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't edit or worry about any files other than the *.js* files.
