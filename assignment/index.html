    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <p>McKynlee's list of Questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>is there a way for me to create a space between two predifined variables
        used to define a new vairable without doing what I did ' ': let fullName=firstName + ' ' + lastName;?</li>
      <li>I believe that when I use cd ~/ in my Terminal I should be able to change to a directory that isn't one step away, but that's not working for me.
      i.e. If I'm on my Desktop and want to go straight to my prime-week-2 directory without having to travel through Prime, Atom, Week-2 directories, I'm not able to.</li>
      <li>I have been unsuccessful at creating a new channel in slack as I follow the steps- do we need special permissions to do that?</li>
      <li>I added this note under #16 which is difficult to see: //Note from McK: I wrote this as if I didn't know the number of pets we each had and so the conditional would withstand as we change number of pets.
      I feel like the question, though, is asking me to set mostPets = something definitive.
      which I didn't get my brain to wrinkle in the right way to pull off!</li>
      <li>For the Swith and Ternary stretch q's #17 & #18, my algebraic instinct really wanted to manipulate the existing variables to create the right outcome
      but I had to create mostAnimals, houseAnimals and Adventure to make it work- is there another way?</li>
      <li>I am obsessed with having you experts to get answers from- it feels like coming into the light after trying to guide myself in the dark: THANK YOU!!</li>
