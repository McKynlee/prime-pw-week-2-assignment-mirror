// REQUIRED FEATURES:
// 1 - Create a variable called `firstName` and assign it the value of your first name

// 2 - Create a second variable called `lastName` and assign it the value of your last name

// 3 - Create a third variable called `fullName`, assign it the value of your first and last name
// (remember, you already have variables for this, can you use those?)

// 4 - Console log the value of `fullName`

// 5 - Create a variable called `age` and assign it the value of your age

// 6 - Console log this sentence, adding in the variables you created above: 
// 'My name is (full name), and I am (age) years old.'.
// Refer back to the videos if you need help with this one.

// 7 - Create a variable named `adventurous` and set it to a boolean value (true or false)

// 8 - Create a variable named `food`, and set its value to a string of your favorite food

// 9 - Create a variable called `pets` and set it to the value of the number of pets you have

// 10 - Create a variable called `friendsPets` and assign it the value of the number of pets your friend has

// 11 - Add two pets to your `pets` variable

// 12 - Create a constant variable called `allowedPets` and set it to a number value of your choice

// 13 - Create a conditional: if adventurous is true, console log "Adventures are great!", 
// if it's not true, console log "How about we stay home?"


// 14 - Create a compound conditional: if age is greater than 18 and adventurous is true,
// console log "Hurray!"

// 15 - Write a conditional that console logs "I can have more pets!" 
//if the value of `pets` is less than the value of `allowedPets`,
// console logs "I have enough pets" if the value of `pets` is equal to the value of `allowedPets`,
// and console logs "Oh no, I have too many pets!"
// if the value of `pets` is greater than the value of `allowedPets`.

// STRETCH GOALS:

// 16 - Make a variable called `mostPets` and a conditional that
// correctly checks the `pets` and `friendsPets` variables, and
// assigns the highest value to `mostPets`. There's several possibilities --
// be sure to think through all the scenarios. 
// console.log `mostPets` after the conditional has run.

// 17 - Rewrite question 16 with a `switch` statement. You'll need to do research!

// 18 -- Rewrite question 13 with a `ternary` operator. You'll need to do research!
