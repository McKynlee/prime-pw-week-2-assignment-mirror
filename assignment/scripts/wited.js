// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// Each code block below is syntactically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE

// 
// 
//

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// 
// 
// 
//

//CODE
/*
let secret;

// REVERSE
// Now, we'll give you a description and some code. Make the code match the description. 
// Look closely -- things are missing and wrong in the code!

//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
//-- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple'
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!)

//6. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4
