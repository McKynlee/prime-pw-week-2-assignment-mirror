// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// Each code block below is syntactically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}
